`// TODO: talk about myself`

| I'm sort of a bootstrapped developer, but I've<br />reached that stage in my career where I just tell<br />other people what do and get yelled at when<br />they do it badly.  In my spare time I have a lot<br />of hobbies that have nothing to do with<br />computers, and most of them involving dirt<br />, snow or booze.  I like Jeeps!  I like hiking<br />into the middle of nowhere and spending<br />a stupid amount of money on gear to pretend<br />to be homeless for extended periods of time.<br />I ski, drink beer, make beer, and sometimes<br />when I've exhausted all other options, I code<br />for fun.  I firmly believe that anything other<br />than c/c++ is for lazy people with ADHD. and<br />and Java is just an annoying insecure trend<br />that hasn't died yet. | ![bathtubSmall](./resources/bathtubSmall.png) |
