# Custom Keggerator build

I've been a home brewer since 2008.  It's a good hobby for a beer enthusiast at well as an engineer as it provides a creative outlet for both.  It does not by any means save you money.  At least not in my experience.  Primarily since every dollar I save, I tend to put back into R&D.  Primarily process development.  This is not the first or last component I created for brewing, and I will have to post more in the future.

### The Inspiration

Since I started brewing I have gone through hot and cold spells.  Primarily due to life.  For me, an all-grain batch, including set-up and take-down and starter cultivation, and finishing takes about 12-15 hours of active work.  Sometimes more before I started kegging.  This doesn't include any receipe research and planning.  The process generally started with starter prep in a Wednesday, the actual brewing process would either be a marathon Saturday project or as I later, started doing, splitting the process into two days.  A week later I'm transfering to secondary, and about a month after that I would go throught the tedious, and messy process of bottling.   In 2016, I had stopped for about a year.  When I decided I wanted to get back into brewing, I began with some self reflection, and decided that if I was going to start again, I needed to accomplish a couple of thing first, both which could be done with kegging:

- Increase quality control.  Unlike professional bottling lines, the home brewing method of bottle carbonation is error-prone and can cause batch to batch and even bottle to bottle inconsistencies.
- Knock a few hours off production time.
- Get rid of the boxes of bottles all over my house.

## The Design

I didn't have a lot of money, what I did have was lots of time and some access to spare parts.  I still had to buy a lot.  Here were the constraints I came up with when coming up with a design.

- It's gotta look cool. I wanted a straignt up bar, with industrial looking taps.
- At least two taps
- Needs to acomodate corney kegs as well as commercial 1/6 kegs.  Originally I wanted to acomodate 1/2 kegs but the required 15" diameter complecated other goals.
- Needs to hold 3 kegs, and have a duel regulator setup so I can serve two beers at one pressure, and carbonate another simotaneously.
- The refrigeration unit needs to fit under the bar.  I only have so much space.
- Need a temperature range between 32F and 70F +/- 1F, allowing for
  - Flexibility on serving temperature (32F - 40F)
  - Ideal protein rest temperatures around 40 F
  -  Summer fermentation temperatures (65F - 70F)


I eventually spec'ed out a 7.5CF chest freezer that seemed to be about the right size.  It wasn't perfect.  Headspace was tight, and the refrigerant was isobutane.  Cold enough for a kegerator, but needs to be grounded for safety reasons, which required me to modify my original design.
